    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza Margherita is roundish in shape with a raised edge (the cornicione) and seasoned with hand-crushed peeled tomatoes, mozzarella (buffalo mozzarella or fior di latte), fresh basil leaves, and extra virgin olive oil. The dough is made by mixing water, salt, and yeast (either sourdough, or fresh or dry baker's yeast) with flour</p>
    <p>The origins of pizza Margherita came from mixing similar toppings that were already present in Naples between 1796 and 1810. In 1849 Emanuele Rocco recorded different pizza toppings including basil, tomatoes, and thin slices of mozzarella added to the toppings already present.</p>
