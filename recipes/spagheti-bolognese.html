    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Spaghetti Bolognese is a popular pasta dish outside of Italy, though it is not considered part of traditional Italian cuisine. The dish typically consists of spaghetti served with a meat-based sauce, often referred to as Bolognese sauce. However, the sauce used in Spaghetti Bolognese often bears little resemblance to the authentic Italian rag√π alla bolognese, which is traditionally served with tagliatelle rather than spaghetti.</p>
    <p>The origins of Spaghetti Bolognese are unclear, but it may have evolved in the context of early 20th-century emigration of southern Italians to the Americas or developed in immigrant restaurants in Britain in the post-war era.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>400g lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cans crushed tomatoes 800g</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 package spaghetti 500g</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook spaghetti uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.</li>

        <li>Add onion, carrot, and oregano to bacon; continue cooking until vegetables begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Crumble in ground beef; cook and stir until no longer pink and completely cooked, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, basil, bring to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Spoon sauce over spaghetti; top with Parmesan cheese to serve.</li>
    </ol>
